# sort-algo-comparison
Running `main.py` will sort the numbers in `numbers.txt` using 6 different algorithms:
1. Counting Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Heap Sort

## Results
`main.py` will print the resulting files in the `/outputs`. The running times for each algorithm will be printed in `/outputs/time_summaries.txt`.

## Warning
`numbers.txt` contains ~3 million integers, so some of the slower algorithms (looking at you insertion + selection) could run on the order of hours depending on the machine.
